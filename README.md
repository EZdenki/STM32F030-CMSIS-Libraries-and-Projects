## STM32F030 CMSIS Libraries and Projects
Here you will find basic libraries and simple project to help you get started in programming the STM32F030 using only CMSIS -- no HAL or STM32CubeIDE, etc.

## Getting Started
+ [STM32F030-CMSIS-Setup](https://github.com/ezdenki/STM32F030-CMSIS-Setup-for-Linux-or-Windows)<br>
A step-by-step guide to setting up your Windows or GNU/Linux PC to program the STM32F030 using CMSIS (no STM32CubeIDE HAL) and the editor of your choice. Takes you from zero to blinky!
+ [STM32F030-CMSIS-Blinky](https://github.com/ezdenki/STM32F030-CMSIS-Blinky)<br>
Minimalist Blinky program for the STM32F030 using only CMSIS.

## STM32F030-CMSIS-ADC
+ [STM32F030-CMSIS-ADC](https://github.com/EZdenki/STM32F030-CMSIS-ADC)<br>
A simple project that demonstrates how to set up and use the analog-to-digital converter on the STM32F030. Reads the voltage from a potentiometer voltage divider and changes the blink-rate of an LED and outputs the ADC value to the serial terminal.
 
## STM32F030-CMSIS-I2C-lib
+ [STM32F030-CMSIS-I2C-lib](https://github.com/EZdenki/STM32F030-CMSIS-I2C-lib)<br>
Basic I2C library for the STM32F030 based on CMSIS (no HAL)
+ [STM32F030-CMSIS-I2C-AHT10-lib](https://github.com/EZdenki/STM32F030-CMSIS-I2C-AHT10-lib)<br>
Library and sample project to use the I2C AHT10 temperature and humidity sensor with CMSIS (no HAL) on the STM32F030

## STM32F030-CMSIS-LCD-lib
+ [STM32F030-CMSIS-LCD-lib](https://github.com/ezdenki/STM32F030-CMSIS-LCD-lib)<br>
Library and simple test project to interface the STM32F030F4xx to a 16x2 (or other) LCD module.

## STM32F030-CMSIS-PWM
+ [STM32F030-CMSIS-PWM-Blinky](https://github.com/ezdenki/STM32F030-CMSIS-PWM-Blinky)<br>
Two simple programs that demonstrate basic PWM functionality by blinking LEDs using PWM using CMSIS on the STM32F030.

## STM32F030-CMSIS-USART-lib
+ [STM32F030-CMSIS-USART-lib](https://github.com/ezdenki/STM32F030-CMSIS-USART-lib)<br>
Simple library and application to give basic serial (RS-232) communication functionality to STM32F030.

## Miscellaneous
+ [STM32F030-CMSIS-I2C-AHT10-lib](https://github.com/EZdenki/STM32F030-CMSIS-I2C-AHT10-lib)<br>
Library and sample project to use the I2C AHT10 temperature and humidity sensor with CMSIS (no HAL) on the STM32F030
+ [STM32F030-Delay-lib](https://github.com/ezdenki/STM32F030-Delay-lib)<br>
Library to give microsecond delay and halt functionality to STM32F030 microcontroller.
