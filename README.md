## STM32F030-Libraries-and-Projects
Here you will find basic libraries and simple project to help you get started in programming the STM32F030 using only CMSIS -- no HAL or STM32CubeIDE, etc.

## Getting Started
+ [STM32F030-CMSIS-Setup](https://github.com/sandynomike/STM32F030-CMSIS-Setup-for-Linux-or-Windows)<br>
A step-by-step guide to setting up your Windows or GNU/Linux PC to program the STM32F030 using CMSIS (no STM32CubeIDE HAL) and the editor of your choice. Takes you from zero to blinky!
+ [STM32F030-CMSIS-Blinky](https://github.com/sandynomike/STM32F030-CMSIS-Blinky)<br>
Minimalist Blinky program for the STM32F030 using only CMSIS.

## STM32F030-CMSIS-PWM
+ [STM32F030-CMSIS-PWM-Blinky](https://github.com/sandynomike/STM32F030-CMSIS-PWM-Blinky)<br>
Two simple programs that demonstrate basic PWM functionality by blinking LEDs using PWM using CMSIS on the STM32F030.

## STM32F030-CMSIS-LCD-lib
+ [STM32F030-CMSIS-LCD-lib](https://github.com/sandynomike/STM32F030-CMSIS-LCD-lib)<br>
Library and simple test project to interface the STM32F030F4xx to a 16x2 (or other) LCD module.

## STM32F030-CMSIS-USART-lib
+ [STM32F030-CMSIS-USART-lib](https://github.com/sandynomike/STM32F030-CMSIS-USART-lib)<br>
Simple library and application to give basic serial (RS-232) communication functionality to STM32F030.

## Miscellaneous
